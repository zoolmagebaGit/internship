## [Getting Started](#getting-started)

To get started with the tasks you need to fork this repo by clicking the fork button on the top right hand corner next to the star button. In the tasks folders you have folders numbered 1, 2, 3. These represent the tasks and where their files should be located.

### Task 1
Create a webpage of technical documentation. It requires knowledge of HTML, CSS and basic javascript. Divide the whole webpage into two sections. The left side creates a menu with all the topics listed from top to bottom. Right side you need to mention the documentation or description for the topics. The idea is once you click on one of the topics in the left section it should load the content on the right. For click, you can use either javascript or CSS bookmark option. You don’t need to make it too fancy, just give it a simple and decent look, that looks good for technical documentation.

### Task 2
Create a webpage of the Cybersec Clinique Website. It requires knowledge in HTML, CSS and basic javascript. Divide the webpage into multiple sections Home, About, Gallery, Contact Us and The Footer. The idea is for you to create a visually designed single paged website while paying attention to best practices like SEO.

### Task 3
Build a survey form for Covid19 Pre-screening Form. It requires knowledge in HTML, CSS and basic javascript. This task will mainly test your skills on all
kinds of inputs apart from your knowledge of forms and structuring your webpage.
